* The DataSquad is trusted to remain neutral, unbiased, and **confidential** in the face of data.
* DataSquad members have the freedom to be generally lost, confused, and also feel safe to seek support from their DataSquad peers and leaders. **It is imperative that individuals report when a project is faltering for any reason.**
* DataSquad members will show consideration toward one another, gracefully provide and accept constructive criticism, and gently call out arrogance or insolence.
* DataSquad members will read and sign the **confidentiality form** and ask questions when there are unclear circumstances.
