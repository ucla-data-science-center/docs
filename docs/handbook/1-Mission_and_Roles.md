# Mission, Services, & Roles

## Our Mission

**We support UCLA researchers, instructors, and staff by helping them work with data, build clear visualizations, and adopt practices that improve reproducibility and open science.**

## Our Services

### Data Wrangling and Transformation
* Helping clients access, import, and organize data from local files, APIs, and cloud platforms  
* Setting up research workflows in Dataverse, GitHub, and other tools  
* Cleaning and restructuring data with Python, R, and related libraries  
* Advising on metadata practices that support documentation, reuse, and long-term management

### Database Design, Data Development, and Lifecycle Planning
* Collecting and combining datasets from multiple sources  
* Querying data warehouses with SQL and similar languages  
* Guiding researchers through planning, managing, publishing, and preserving data across a full project lifecycle

### Data Visualization and Storytelling
* Creating clear visualizations using Tableau, R ggplot2, Shiny, Python, Excel, and web-based tools  
* Advising on visualization choices that match research questions and audiences  

### Reproducibility and Open Science Support
* Testing whether research code runs start to finish  
* Reviewing documentation, folder structure, and data completeness  
* Helping teams adopt open science practices linked to the UCLA OSPO, including licensing, citation, and publication workflows

### Statistical and Analytical Support
* Applying statistical methods to research questions  
* Helping clients choose appropriate tests and interpret results using R, Python, Stata, or SPSS

### Emerging Tech, 3D Data, and Computational Methods
* Assisting with 3D models, geospatial workflows, and immersive data projects  
* Supporting file management, metadata preparation, and visualization for 3D, LIDAR, drone, and photogrammetry datasets  
* Collaborating with Library units exploring new modalities in research and instruction

## Our Tenets

* The DataSquad works with data in any form and supports clients in using it responsibly.  
* We do not alter or reinterpret the substance of a client’s data or attempt to change their research questions.  
* We maintain neutrality, confidentiality, and trust in all consulting interactions.  
* Team members can ask for help at any point. We expect people to speak up early when a project becomes unclear or stalls.  
* We treat one another with respect, offer constructive feedback, and address unhelpful behavior when it appears.  
* All team members read and sign the confidentiality agreement and raise questions when situations need clarification.
