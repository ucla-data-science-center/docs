# 📊 LibInsight Consultation Logging Guide

## Why We Use LibInsight

By using LibInsight, we provide the Library with data on how we operate and how often we receive consultations. This data is important because it demonstrates that the DataSquad produces work and is actively consulting.

## What to Record and When

After performing any consultation (in person or online), you must fill out the LibInsight Form.

| Item to Record | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Consultations** | After performing any consultation (in person or online). |
| **Internal Meetings** | Record any meeting that you organize within the DataSquad or DSC. |
| **External Communications** | Emails between you and a client can also be recorded. |

Our goal is to leave a record of the work that we have done and provided in as many forms as possible.
