Publicity and Blog Posts

Every completed project needs a short blog post (200 to 500 words).
Posts should:

- Summarize the problem and solution
- Highlight results or tools used
- Be reviewed by Tim, Leig or Doug
- Include clear tags
- Identify the student author

Blogs help document impact and support future funding.

### Additional Tools

- Slack for internal communication
- GitHub Projects for task tracking
- Google Docs for shared writing
- Zoom for remote consulting
