# Resources & Administration

## Google Drive Organization

We use the **data-science-center** Shared Drive: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AKFJ0mo2-HebUk9PVA](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AKFJ0mo2-HebUk9PVA).

## GitHub Organization <https://github.com/UCLA-DataSquad>

When setting up a new repository:

1.  **Creation:** Create the repo under the **UCLA-DataSquad** organization. Ensure it is **private** and includes a **README**.
2.  **Initial Push:** Use the following commands (assuming `main` is the primary branch):

    ```bash
    git add --all
    git commit -m 'Initial commit of project files'
    git push origin main
    ```

## Publicity & Blogging

* A blog post (200-500 words) must be written/co-written for every completed project.
* Posts must be run by Tim or Zhiyuan before publishing.
* **Tagging:** Use appropriate tags (e.g., outreach, data wrangling, visualization, carpentry) and always include your name as a tag.
