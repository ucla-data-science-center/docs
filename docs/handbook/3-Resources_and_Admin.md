## GitHub Organizations

### 1. `data-science-center` (project work)

This is the primary home for **all project-related repositories**, including reproducible workflows, code, documentation, and collaboration with clients.
Organization link: [https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center](https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center)

**When creating a new client or research project repo:**

1. Create the repo under **ucla-data-science-center**.
2. Make it **private** unless the project should be public.
3. Add a short README with project goals and setup notes.
4. Push initial files:

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

### 2. `UCLA-DataSquad` (website and blog only)

This organization is used for the **DataSquad website and blog**.
It is not used for consulting or client work.

## Publicity and Blogging

* Every completed project needs a blog post (200 to 500 words).
* Posts are reviewed by Tim or Zhiyuan before publication.
* Use clear tags such as outreach, data wrangling, visualization, open science, or consulting.
* Always tag yourself as the author.
