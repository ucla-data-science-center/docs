# 📚 DataSquad Handbook

Welcome to the official DataSquad Handbook, a program of the UCLA Library Data Science Center.

This guide lays out the mission, protocols, project guidelines, and professional development expectations for all DataSquad members. Use the sidebar to navigate the different sections.

## Scheduling and Consultations (LibCal)

DataSquad consultations are scheduled through LibCal, the UCLA Library’s appointment and intake system. Each consultant publishes individual availability in LibCal and uses a shared intake form so consultations can be supported, reassigned, and tracked as a team-based service.

**Before taking appointments, complete the DataSquad LibCal Setup Checklist.**
