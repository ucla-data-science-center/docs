# Offboarding

Use this checklist when you finish work with the DataSquad.  
The goal is to close out projects, transfer knowledge, and ensure that your work remains usable by future students.

---

## Wrap Up Active Projects

Before leaving:

- Make sure all code, notebooks, documentation, and data are stored in the correct **client project repo** under `ucla-data-science-center`.  
- Add a short README update with project status.  
- Close or reassign any open issues.  
- Move any working files to the correct Google Drive folders.

If you are unsure where something belongs, check with Tim or Jamie.

---

## Access Removal

After your last work day, access will be removed from:

- Google Shared Drives  
- GitHub Organizations  
- Slack  
- Internal project boards  
- Any private DSC tools or integrations

Make sure all needed files are checked in before your access ends.

---

## Final Steps

- Inform Tim when your wrap-up work is complete.  
- Return any DSC equipment if assigned.  
- Submit the final timesheet and confirm hours.  
- Optional: write a short handoff note about what you learned or what future students should know.

You can always ask for a reference or letter later.  
We want to support your next steps.
