# Onboarding

New DataSquad members use this guide during their first week.  
Your very first step is to create an **Onboarding Ticket** so we can track progress and activate your access.

---

# 1. Create Your Onboarding Ticket

Open the issue template here:

**https://github.com/ucla-data-science-center/DataSquad/issues/new/choose**

Choose **DataSquad Student Onboarding**.

Then:

1. Add your name to the issue title  
   `Onboarding: YOUR NAME`
2. Fill out the form fields (name, UCLA email, GitHub username, skills, interests)
3. Submit the issue  
4. Use the checklists in the issue as your task list for the week

Your onboarding ticket becomes your working record.

---

# 2. Accounts and Access

## GitHub (required for all projects)

Your GitHub account must use your **UCLA login email** because the  
**ucla-data-science-center GitHub Enterprise organization requires UCLA SSO**.  
If your GitHub account is tied to a personal email, add your UCLA email before joining.

After that:

- Tim or Leigh will add you to  
  - `ucla-data-science-center` (project work)  
  - `UCLA-DataSquad` (website and blog)

## Google Drive

You’ll be added to the **data-science-center** Shared Drive.

Key folders:

### `data-squad`  
Work logs, handbook, admin docs, meeting notes  
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oNojx83bIXmwvG3GbIPlmQ4DXhzh4KIF>

### `consulting`  
Client-facing project folders, intake notes, deliverables  
<https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14feMpx9VpOiCcDHugOysyiskQxQXafQt>

---

# 3. Required Documents

## Confidentiality Form  
Must be signed before any client work:

You don’t need to finish these in a week. Start now and continue through your first month.
