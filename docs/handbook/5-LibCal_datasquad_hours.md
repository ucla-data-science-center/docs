# LibCal Hours Guide

This guide explains how to update the hours shown on LibCal for the DataSquad. You can adjust the weekly schedule or add one-time exceptions when the office is closed.

## Logging In

LibCal uses the `@ucla.edu` login.  
Use the credentials stored in the secure document in the DataSquad shared drive.

Log in at:  
**https://ucla.libapps.com/libapps/login.php?site_id=17197&target=admin/welcome**

You may see a message about LibInsight authorization. This is normal. Select **Calendar** on the home page.

## Updating Weekly Hours

Update the hours each quarter or whenever the in-person walk-in schedule changes. Hours should match the times when a DataSquad member is available in the office.

### Steps

1. Hover over the settings icon and select **Hours**.

4. Update the hours on that page so they match the current in-person schedule.

## Adding Exceptions

Exceptions let you mark days when the office is closed. These do not change the weekly template. They record one-time closures such as finals week or spring break.

### Steps

1. Go to **Hours** in the settings menu.
