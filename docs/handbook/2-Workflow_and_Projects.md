# Project Workflow & GitHub

## Overall Workflow

| Purpose | Tool | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Tracking** | **GitHub Projects** | Used for all project and professional development tracking. |
| **Documentation** | **Google Drive** | Used for work logs, specific resources, and longer descriptions. |
| **Communication** | **Slack** | Used for all internal, quick communication. |
| **Code Repository** | **GitHub** | Used for storing code and archives. |

## Project Guidelines

### Project Intake

1.  **Client Intake:** Scheduled through our designated process (TBD, formerly Calendly).
2.  **GitHub Setup:** Create a **GitHub Issue** on the **"Data Science Center Projects"** board: [https://github.com/orgs/ucla-data-science-center/projects/3](https://github.com/orgs/ucla-data-science-center/projects/3).

**Intake Checklist:** The Issue must include the description, client info, resources, obstacles, and a timeline.

### Doing the Work (Tracking)

* **Documentation:** Document your work in a Google Doc within the **Consulting folder** (`YEAR_MONTH_CLIENTFIRSTNAME_CLIENTLASTNAME`). Use **GitHub Issue comments** for progress updates.
* **Communication:** Respond to Slack messages within **24 hours** or your next work shift.
* **Seeking Help:** If you are stuck, seek support immediately by mentioning a peer or supervisor on the GitHub Issue (`@username`).

### Completing & Archiving

Once the project goals are achieved:

1.  **Final Check:** Confirm satisfaction with the client/recipient.
2.  **Archiving Steps:**
    * **GitHub Projects:** Move the project card to the appropriate **Done** column.
    * **Google Drive:** Move documentation files into the Consulting Drive archive folder.
    * **GitHub Repos:** Move the associated repository to the `completed-projects` section/folder.

## GitHub Projects (Project Management)

GitHub Projects is our source of record, replacing Trello.

* **Project Board:** We use the **Data Science Center Projects** board.
* **Assignment:** Assign yourself to an Issue using the **Assignees** option.
* **Status Update:** Track internal progress by ticking off checklist items within the Issue body.
