# Preservation
<hr/>

## Content
- Scope: We allow all research objects created from research and educational projects at UCLA to be made publicly available, discoverable, linkable, and ultimately, reusable.
- Stage of research data: Data from any stage of the research lifecycle is accepted
- Eligibility: You are a faculty member, staff member, or student and have a UCLA Logon ID
- Rights: By uploading content, no change of ownership is implied and no property rights are transferred to the UCLA Library. All uploaded content remains the property of the parties prior to submission
- Data file formats: All formats are allowed - even preservation unfriendly. Dataverse will convert certain tabular data formats (Stata, XLS, R, SPSS) into plane-text tab delimited files.
- Volume and size limitations: Total files size limit per record is 50GB. Higher quotas can be requested and granted on a case-by-case basis.
- Data quality: All information is provided as-is, and the user holds UCLA and information providers supplying data to UCLA free and harmless in connection with the use of such information.
- Metadata types and sources:
- Licenses: Users must specify a license for all publicly available files. Licenses for closed access files may be specified in the description field.

## How do I know I am ready to deposit?
- All confidential, restricted, legally protected, and/or private content (e.g. personally identifiable information) has been removed from your data, and the data is sufficiently anonymized/de-identified

## What are the restrictions?
- Deposits must contain unrestricted content with no private, confidential, or otherwise legally restricted information. If applicable, data should be de-identified and anonymized.

## What types of data can be deposited?
- Any data, such as data, text, software, scripts, data visualizations, etc. from any discipline may be deposited.
- UCLA Dataverse administrators do not attempt to judge the scholarly quality of deposited data; this is the responsibility of the depositor.
- UCLA Dataverse administrators may may review data for alignment with deposit criteria and work with depositors to extend the descriptive metadata as required for discoverability,
- Where appropriate, UCLA Dataverse administrators will recommend (but not mandate) that data be deposited in formats that align with preservation best practices.

## Can deposits be escrowed/embargoed?
- Dataverse doesn't support escrowed/embargoed datasets (timed release), however, you can keep your data as a draft.

## After you deposit
- Each dataset will received a DOI that serves as a permanent link to that dataset. In addition, UCLA Dataverse will register your descriptive metadata with the DataCite Metadata Store to enhance discoverability.
- Data published in UCLA Dataverse are discoverable and openly available to anyone with access to the Internet.
- In some specific cases, data may be withdrawn from UCLA Dataverse. These include demonstrated copyright violation, violations of legal requirements, verified plagiarism, falsified research, and for reasons of National Security. Withdrawn items are not deleted, but will be removed from public view. As appropriate, UCLA Dataverse will redirect DOI’s for withdrawn items to “tombstone” sites which will contain details of the reason for the withdrawal, and provide links to replacement content if it is available.

## Preservation policy
The UCLA Dataverse will store deposited data for a minimum of 10 years beyond the date of initial publication UCLA Dataverse also currently commits to providing public access through maintenance of persistent UCLA Dataverse webpages, descriptive metadata records, and identifiers, as well as providing access metrics, which may include page-views, downloads, and citations.

All UCLA Dataverse content, both data and metadata, is backed up regularly according to current best practices. Additionally, all UCLA Dataverse content is checksummed to ensure that file integrity is retained in the future.
