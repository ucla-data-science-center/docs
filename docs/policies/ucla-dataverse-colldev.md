# UCLA Dataverse Collection Development Policy

UCLA Dataverse is an open-access data repository operated by the UCLA Library Data Science Center (DSC). It supports UCLA researchers in sharing, preserving, and citing datasets that underpin their scholarship. This policy describes what may be deposited, who can deposit, and how the DSC supports long-term access and responsible stewardship.

## What is UCLA Dataverse?

UCLA Dataverse is a platform for sharing and preserving research outputs ‚Äî including data, code, documentation, and related materials ‚Äî created at UCLA. Each dataset receives a stable DOI and is stored in an environment that supports discovery, reuse, and compliance with many publisher and funder requirements.

---

## Am I Ready to Deposit?

You‚Äôre ready to deposit if:

- You are a UCLA faculty member, student, or staff with a valid UCLA Logon ID  
- Your data is final (not a draft), organized clearly, and fully documented  
- You have de-identified or removed private, confidential, or restricted information  
- You hold the rights to share the dataset or have obtained the appropriate permissions  
- You are prepared to assign a license (default is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode))  

---

## Who Can Deposit?

- UCLA faculty, students, and staff  
- Non-UCLA collaborators may deposit if working with UCLA-affiliated researchers  
- Depositors must have a substantial intellectual contribution to the dataset  
- Third-party or commercial datasets are not accepted unless permission is clearly documented

All submissions are reviewed by repository staff for completeness and eligibility.

---

## What Can Be Deposited?

We accept research outputs from any discipline, including:

- Tabular or statistical data  
- Qualitative or textual data  
- Scripts, software, and codebooks  
- Visualizations, multimedia, and documentation

Data must support scholarly research or reproducibility and must not include:

- Personally identifiable information (PII)  
- Confidential, licensed, or embargoed third-party content without proper clearance  
- Drafts, notes, or preliminary working materials

---

## Deposit Conditions

Deposited materials should meet the following conditions:

- Include descriptive metadata to enable discovery  
- Be in broadly usable formats (e.g., CSV, TXT, PDF, JPG, WAV, MP4)  
- Be organized and documented so they are understandable to others  
- Be in their final version (not subject to ongoing revision)  
- Have a designated contact person for follow-up if needed  

Depositors may embargo their dataset for up to 12 months, with extensions considered by request.

---

## Licensing & Copyright

- The default license is [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)  
- Depositors may select an alternative license (e.g., CC BY 4.0 or custom terms)  
- Depositors are responsible for ensuring their selected license is accurate and enforceable  
- Copyright remains with the original creators unless otherwise noted  

If copyright concerns arise, UCLA Library will follow the University‚Äôs [DMCA takedown procedures](http://www.library.ucla.edu/support/publishing-data-management/scholarly-communication-resources-education/ucla-library-copyright-policy/uc-systemwide-copyright-policies).

---

## Review & Curation

After submission:

- Your deposit is reviewed by Library staff  
- We may assist with improving metadata or ensuring discoverability  
- We register the DOI and descriptive metadata with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/)  
- Once published, datasets are discoverable globally and openly accessible  

---

## Access and Reuse

- Public access is the default. Depositors may restrict specific files or apply access controls.
- All users agree to the applicable data license before downloading.  
- Depositors may request citation and attribution guidance be included in dataset metadata.

Datasets may not be reused for commercial purposes without appropriate licensing.

---

## Preservation Commitments

- Datasets are retained for a minimum of **5 years** from the date of publication  
- We back up content regularly, apply file integrity checks, and maintain stable DOIs  
- Metadata and landing pages remain accessible even if the dataset is withdrawn  
- Proprietary formats are accepted ‚Äúas-is.‚Äù We encourage open formats but do not guarantee format migration

---

## Versioning and Updates

- Depositors may submit new versions of their dataset at any time  
- Earlier versions remain accessible unless restricted by request  
- All versions are linked through the persistent DOI record

---

## Takedown and Withdrawal

Datasets may be withdrawn for:

- Copyright violation or takedown request  
- Legal or privacy concerns  
- Falsified or retracted research  
- National security

Withdrawn datasets will be redirected to a ‚Äútombstone‚Äù landing page explaining the reason for removal. Metadata may be retained for transparency.
