## UCLA Dataverse Collection Development Policy

### Purpose  
UCLA Dataverse, hosted by the UCLA Library Data Science Center (DSC), supports the sharing, preservation, and discovery of research data produced by UCLA scholars and collaborators. This policy outlines the types of materials accepted into UCLA Dataverse, the responsibilities of depositors, and the commitments made by the Library and DSC to ensure long-term stewardship and access.

### Scope of the Collection  
UCLA Dataverse accepts datasets and related materials from research in the social sciences, health sciences, humanities, STEM, and other disciplines. We welcome:

- Raw and processed data (quantitative, qualitative, geospatial, etc.)
- Codebooks, instruments, documentation, and metadata
- Derived or summarized data that supports reproducibility
- Models, simulations, and related outputs

We do not accept paper records or completed survey forms.

### Who Can Deposit  
We prioritize deposits from:

- UCLA faculty, students, and staff  
- Collaborators working with UCLA researchers  
- Other contributors whose data aligns with the goals of UCLA Dataverse and meets technical and ethical requirements  

All depositors must have the right to share the data and agree to UCLA Dataverseâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://dataverse.ucla.edu).

### What We Expect from Depositors  
To support long-term access and reuse, depositors are expected to:

- Provide data in widely used, non-proprietary or convertible formats (e.g., CSV, TXT, SAV, DTA, PDF)  
- Supply full documentation, including descriptions, instruments, or code when applicable  
- Remove direct identifiers and ensure data is de-identified or legally cleared for sharing  
- Choose an appropriate license (default is CC0) and ensure that reuse conditions are clear  
- Follow applicable ethical, legal, and IRB requirements  

DSC reserves the right to decline deposits that are incomplete, non-reusable, or legally problematic.

### Access and Reuse  
UCLA Dataverse promotes open access. Datasets are made publicly available unless depositors request access restrictions. Depositors may:

- Place temporary embargoes  
- Use custom licenses or agreements  
- Restrict files to authenticated users

All users must agree to the applicable terms before downloading data. Metadata is always publicly visible unless embargoed.

### Curation and Preservation  
The DSC will:

- Review submissions for basic quality, documentation, and privacy compliance  
- Assign persistent identifiers (DOIs)  
- Provide long-term storage and backup  
- Convert data formats when necessary to maintain access  
- Enable metadata harvesting via OAI-PMH

We follow best practices in digital preservation but cannot guarantee perpetual readability of proprietary formats.

### Versioning  
New versions of datasets can be published at any time. Previous versions remain accessible unless withdrawn by request.

### Withdrawal and Removal  
Datasets may be withdrawn for legal, ethical, or confidentiality reasons. Metadata may be retained for transparency. If UCLA Dataverse ceases operation, we will make reasonable efforts to transfer custody of datasets to another trusted repository or return them to the depositor.
